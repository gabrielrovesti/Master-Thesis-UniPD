- How to introduce: The "Hello world" for accessibility (very good idea) - to make in script ⭕
- Compact Slide 2 and Slide 3 into one and merging their meaning together ✔️ (from now on, all slides have one lesser number, keep an eye)
- Slide 5: Take time and properly introduce the RQs and make a reader understand this is specifically for developers and not for users - to make in script ⭕
- Replace Slide 6 with a cut video to talk about the app itself and make it focus on main screens and how SRs read it ✔️
- Slide 7: Refine slide to properly discuss how to bridge theory and practice (make workflow better refined into a single platform - side personal note) ✔️
- Slides 8 and 9: Refine those using the screens of before and showing by the side the tables used in research and make speech smoother ✔️
- Slide 11: Is the accessibility implementation more costly only for React Native or for both? In general good slide ✔️
- Slide 12: Good for the metrics part here, explain smoother
- Before Slide 13: Focus more on the fact the code you added is yours and make a screen by screen comparison of the code of both frameworks (keeping the bullet point), then go to slide 13 and the image - explain or change "Decision factor"
- Slide 14: Remove Manual and put only a legend for said table inside of slide for V and X - make a better comparison
- Slide 15: Focus more on the developer choice; probably, refine better the table here
- Slide 16: I think this works - you do you

Side note:
- Don't cover the slide number yourself presenting
- "As far as my knowledge goes" and "cross platform frameworks"
- Focus the fact that my research is both practical and theoretical; you did not only counted the lines of code, but did much more, both on metrics formally and the added code itself (compared to Budai thesis)

    ``We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.''} \\

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Gaggi, given her support throughout two paths of thesis, both in bachelor and master degree, for valuable knowledge and support throughout these academic years, both humanly and academically.

\noindent I would like to thank my mum, the only person who supported me practically throughout these years and my girlfriend Erica, who was not only a real friend, but also a great human being, a person I would always like to have in my life, given her unconditional support and help throughout these years.

\noindent A special thank you to the few real friends I have, because they helped me do many things up until now and I wouldn't live a day without them.

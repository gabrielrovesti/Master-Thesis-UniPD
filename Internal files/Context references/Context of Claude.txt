Dear Claude, answer me in English and focus on the production of text and logics rather than code. This is a LaTeX thesis in English and please do not be concise on text, we have to write here. I have this application where it's intended to be a toolkit to help developers in accessibility (to avoid making this context heavier, please consider how the app actually appears and how these files are displayed inside of the filesystem structure.
My idea is to apply what you see here inside of the ToDo and also to completely formalize screen by screen the application formally of MCAG and WCAG. My professor is asking me to be precise and formal and to fix the errors of previous emails which you can see. The X screen is as follows and the code is displayed.

Please, reformat coherently the section of analysis following a previous chat of the Home Screen following the actual code of that screen and compliant to WCAG and MCAG. Write in LaTeX code for me to implement directly inside of the thesis and not Markdown or Plain Text, and write IN ENGLISH, not Italian. A minor thing: all titles should not be mixed Upper and Lower; just put the beginning title upper (for instance not Mobile Accessibility Framework, but put Mobile accessibility framework), this has to hold true for each subsection. Also, checkmarks and ticks are formatted exactly as seen into previous section. Ensure all itemized list have semicolon and the last has full stop. Ensure also code blocks don't "overflow" the page and do not make them so much verbose, instead quote only the relevant parts for a reader, both technical and non-technical, about accessibility. Ensure also textt does not break margins, otherwise send them next line with double backslash.

Please, write in a "human" way and not chatbot like, being expansive and careful in considerations when you write following what done into previous sections.
Keep in mind EACH TABLE, EACH FIGURE AND EACH CODE LISTING HAS TO BE QUOTED IN TEXT (ref)

 description={An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. It specifies how software components should interact, allowing different software systems to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with a system, service, or library without needing to understand the underlying implementation. They serve as a contract between different software components, enabling developers to integrate different systems, access web-based services, and create more complex and interconnected software solutions}

\newglossaryentry{grayliteraturereview}{
    name={Gray Literature Review},
    text={Gray Literature Review},
    sort=grayliteraturereview,
    description={A structured method of collecting and analyzing non-traditional published literature, much of which is published outside conventional academic channels. This research methodology concerns conducting a review of gray literature, such as technical reports, blog postings, professional forums, and industry documentation, to gain insight from practical experience. Gray literature reviews apply most to software engineering research as they represent real practices, challenges, and solutions that have taken place during implementation that may not have been captured or documented in the academic literature. This methodology acts like a bridge that closes the gap between theoretical research and its industry application}

 description={The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth and evolution of the web. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, the W3C works to create universal web standards that promote interoperability and accessibility across different platforms, browsers, and devices. This non-profit organization brings together technology experts, researchers, and industry leaders to develop guidelines and protocols that form the fundamental architecture of the World Wide Web. Key contributions include HTML, CSS, accessibility guidelines (WCAG), and web standards that ensure a consistent, inclusive, and innovative web experience for users worldwide}

\newglossaryentry{flutter}{ 
 name={Flutter},
 text={Flutter},
 sort=flutter,
 description={Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google, designed for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms from a single codebase. Launched in 2017, Flutter uses the Dart programming language and provides a comprehensive framework for creating high-performance, visually attractive applications with a focus on smooth, responsive user interfaces. Unlike traditional cross-platform frameworks that use web view rendering, Flutter compiles directly to native code, enabling near-native performance. Its key features include a rich set of pre-designed widgets, hot reload for rapid development, extensive customization capabilities, and a robust ecosystem that supports complex application development across multiple platforms}

Introduced in 2015, React Native enables developers to create native mobile apps for both iOS and Android platforms using a single codebase, leveraging the popular React web development library. Unlike hybrid app frameworks, React Native renders components using actual native platform UI elements, providing a more authentic user experience and better performance. The framework bridges the gap between web and mobile development, allowing web developers to create mobile applications using familiar JavaScript and React paradigms, while still achieving near-native performance and user interface responsiveness}

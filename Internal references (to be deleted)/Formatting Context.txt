Write in LaTeX code for me to implement directly inside of the thesis and not Markdown or Plain Text, and write IN ENGLISH, not Italian. A minor thing: all titles should not be mixed Upper and Lower; just put the beginning title upper (for instance not Mobile Accessibility Framework, but put Mobile accessibility framework), this has to hold true for each subsection. Also, checkmarks and ticks are formatted exactly as seen into previous section. Ensure all itemized list have semicolon and the last has full stop. Ensure also code blocks don't "overflow" the page and do not make them so much verbose, instead quote only the relevant parts for a reader, both technical and non-technical, about accessibility. Ensure also textt does not break margins, otherwise send them next line with double backslash. Ensure AccessibleHub name is coherent always, having \textit{AccessibleHub} and special chars like % are escaped with backslash. \checkmark does not exist in my case, replace it with ding, same for X and adopt the presented style for code listings, ensuring they are referenced correctly always.

Please, write in a "human" way and not chatbot like, being expansive and careful in considerations when you write following what done into previous sections.
Keep in mind EACH TABLE, EACH FIGURE AND EACH CODE LISTING HAS TO BE QUOTED IN TEXT (ref)

The co-relator (contro-relatore) only gives you an opinion at least 5 days before the discussion, nothing else. No further corrections are to be expected from that and also you do not need to quote it in the thesis. The co-relator is not a member of the committee and does not have to be present at the discussion. 

Just some info because I was confused about this at first.

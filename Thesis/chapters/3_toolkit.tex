\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Challenges in implementing accessibility guidelines}

The importance of mobile app accessibility extends beyond mere compliance with legal regulations.. Ensuring equal access to digital content and services is not only an ethical obligation but also a smart business decision. By prioritizing accessibility, app developers and companies can tap into a larger user base, improve user satisfaction, and demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility.
Despite the clear benefits and moral imperatives of mobile app accessibility, many developers still struggle to effectively implement accessibility guidelines in their projects. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), serve as the international standard for digital accessibility. However, translating these guidelines into practical implementation can be a challenging task, particularly starting from pure formal guidelines into everyday code. \\

One of the primary challenges lies in the complexity of the guidelines themselves. WCAG encompasses a wide range of \textit{success criteria}, organized under four main general \textit{principles}: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Each principle contains multiple guidelines, and each guideline has several success criteria at different levels of conformance (A, AA, AAA). Navigating this intricate web of requirements and understanding how to apply them to specific mobile app components can be overwhelming for developers, especially those new to accessibility. 
Moreover, the practical implementation of accessibility guidelines often varies across different platforms and frameworks. iOS and Android, the two dominant mobile operating systems, have their own unique accessibility APIs, tools, and best practices. Cross-platform frameworks like React Native and Flutter add another layer of complexity, as developers must ensure that their accessibility implementations are compatible with the underlying platform-specific mechanisms. \\ 

Furthermore, there is often a lack of clear, practical examples and guidance on how to implement accessibility features in real-world mobile app projects. While the WCAG provides a solid foundation, it is primarily focused on web content and may not always directly address the unique challenges and interaction patterns of mobile apps. Developers often struggle to bridge the gap between the theoretical guidelines and the specific implementation details required for their projects.

\subsection{The need for practical developer education}

To address these challenges and bridge the gap between accessibility guidelines and practical implementation, there is a pressing need for developer education resources that focus on real-world, hands-on learning experiences. Traditional documentation and guidelines, while valuable, often fall short in providing the level of detail and interactivity needed to effectively guide developers through the accessibility implementation process.
This is where the concept of an \textit{accessibility learning toolkit} comes into play. An accessibility toolkit is designed to serve as a comprehensive, interactive resource that empowers developers to create accessible mobile applications by providing:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clear explanations of WCAG guidelines and their applicability to mobile apps
    \item Step-by-step implementation guidance for common mobile app components and interaction patterns
    \item Practical code examples and tutorials that demonstrate best practices
    \item Hands-on exercises and challenges to reinforce learning and build confidence
    \item Tools and techniques for testing and validating the accessibility of mobile apps
\end{enumerate}

The primary goal of an accessibility learning toolkit is to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge of accessibility guidelines and the practical skills needed to implement them effectively in real-world projects. 
The toolkit should cater to developers at various levels of expertise, from beginners who are new to accessibility concepts to experienced professionals seeking to deepen their knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest best practices. By providing a comprehensive, hands-on learning resource, the accessibility toolkit can play a crucial role in promoting a culture of inclusive design and development within the mobile app industry. \\

Current research, including Budai's work on Flutter accessibility testing, has primarily focused on end-user validation and testing methodologies. However, developers need practical, implementation-focused guidance that bridges multiple frameworks and platforms.
Despite widespread accessibility guidelines and standard, mobile application developers face significant challenges in translating theoretical requirements into practical implementations. This gap between guidelines and implementation is particularly evident in mobile development, where different platforms, screen sizes, and interaction models add complexity to accessibility implementation. Some of the most common challenges include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex testing requirements - developers must validate across multiple devices, screen readers, and interaction modes
    \item Framework-specific implementations - each platform has unique accessibility APIs and requirements
    \item Limited practical examples - most documentation focuses on theoretical guidelines rather than concrete implementation patterns
    \item Performance considerations - accessibility features must be implemented without compromising app performance
\end{itemize}

This thesis addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive guide for implementing accessibility features and offering a structured comparison between frameworks, offering developers a fast sand precise way to implement such guidelines inside of their projects. 

\subsection{Research objectives and methodology}

Building upon previous research into mobile accessibility, this work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of accessibility implementation across major cross-platform frameworks. While existing research indeed set grounds for both guidelines on accessibility and testing methodologies, there is a critical need to understand how these guidelines translate into practice for developers. 

This research addresses three fundamental questions about accessibility implementation in mobile development frameworks (referring to these ones as \textit{research questions}, following the work in \cite{perinello2024accessibility}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First, we investigate whether components and widgets provided by frameworks are \textit{accessible by default}, without requiring additional developer intervention. This analysis is crucial for understanding the baseline accessibility support provided by each framework and identifying areas where additional implementation effort may be required.
    \item Second, we examine the \textit{feasibility of making non-accessible components accessible} through additional development effort. This involves analyzing the technical capabilities of each framework and identifying the necessary modifications to achieve accessibility compliance.
    \item Third, we quantify the \textit{development overhead required to implement accessibility features} when they are not provided by default. This includes measuring additional code requirements, analyzing complexity increases, and evaluating the impact on development workflows.
\end{itemize}

These questions is addressed via the usage of a systematic methodology aiming to address in detail accessibility support in React Native and Flutter, focusing on component implementation patterns and native platform integration. The implementation is comparative, allowing developers to directly implement accessible code examples with different degrees of implementation complexity measured quantitatively (including lines of code, required properties, and additional components needed for accessibility support). Comprehensive testing of implementations is also done using screen readers and other assistive technologies to verify accessibility compliance.

The \textit{goal} is to create an accessible application that serves three key purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To provide developers with practical, interactive examples of accessibility implementation, able to be copied easily and ported inside of other projects;
    \item To compare and contrast accessibility approaches between the main cross-development mobile frameworks in the current mobile landscape;
    \item To establish a reusable pattern library that demonstrates engine architecture, widget systems, and native platform integration, while ensuring compliance with current accessibility guidelines and legal requirements.
\end{enumerate}

The following sections will detail the development of AccessibleHub, an application developed in React Native designed to serve as a practical manual for implementing accessibility features. While the technical aspects of cross-platform frameworks will be discussed later, the focus remains on providing developers with actionable implementation patterns and comparative insights for building accessible applications.

\section{Accessibility guidelines and standards}
\label{sec:guidelines}

Accessibility guidelines and standards form the foundation upon which inclusive mobile app development practices are built. They provide a shared framework for understanding and addressing the diverse needs of users with disabilities, ensuring that mobile apps are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. This section explores the key accessibility guidelines and standards relevant to mobile app development, with a particular focus on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and mobile-specific considerations.

\subsection{Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)}

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), serve as the international standard for digital accessibility. Although originally designed for web content, the WCAG principles and guidelines are equally applicable to mobile app development. The WCAG is organized around four main principles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Perceivable}: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, creating content that can be presented in different ways without losing meaning, and making it easier for users to see and hear content.
    \item \textit{Operable}: User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that all functionality should be available from a keyboard, users should have enough time to read and use the content, and content should not cause seizures or physical reactions.
    \item \textit{Understandable}: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This involves making text content readable and understandable, making content appear and operate in predictable ways, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.
    \item \textit{Robust}: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This requires maximizing compatibility with current and future user agents.
\end{itemize}

Under each principle, the WCAG provides specific guidelines and success criteria at three levels of conformance (A, AA, and AAA). These success criteria are testable statements that help developers determine whether their app meets the accessibility requirements. By understanding and applying the WCAG principles and guidelines, mobile app developers can create more inclusive and accessible experiences for their users.

\subsection{Mobile-specific accessibility considerations}

While the WCAG provides a solid foundation for digital accessibility, mobile apps present unique challenges and considerations that require additional attention. Some of the key mobile-specific accessibility factors include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Touch interaction}: Mobile devices rely heavily on touch-based interactions, such as tapping, swiping, and multi-finger gestures. Developers must ensure that all interactive elements are large enough to be easily tapped, provide alternative input methods for complex gestures, and offer appropriate haptic and visual feedback.
    \item \textit{Small screens}: The limited screen real estate on mobile devices can pose challenges for users with visual impairments. Developers should provide sufficient contrast, use clear and legible fonts, and ensure that content can be easily zoomed or resized without losing functionality.
    \item \textit{Screen reader Compatibility}: Mobile screen readers, such as VoiceOver on iOS and TalkBack on Android, require proper labeling and semantic structure to effectively convey content and functionality to users with visual impairments. Developers must use appropriate accessibility APIs and ensure that all elements are properly labeled and navigable.
    \item \textit{Device fragmentation}: The wide range of mobile devices, screen sizes, and operating system versions can complicate accessibility testing and implementation. Developers should test their apps on a diverse range of devices and ensure that accessibility features function consistently across different configurations.
    \item \textit{Mobile context}: Mobile apps are often used in a variety of contexts, such as outdoors, in low-light conditions, or in noisy environments. Developers should consider these contexts and provide appropriate accommodations, such as high-contrast modes or subtitles for audio content.
\end{itemize}

By understanding and addressing these mobile-specific accessibility considerations, developers can create apps that are more inclusive and usable for a wider range of users.

\section{AccessibleHub: An Interactive Learning Toolkit}
\label{sec:accessiblehub}

\subsection{Core architecture and design principles}

AccessibleHub is a React Native application designed to serve as an interactive manual for implementing accessibility features in mobile development. Unlike traditional documentation or testing frameworks, the application provides developers with hands-on examples and implementation patterns that can be directly applied to their projects.

The application is structured around four main sections:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Component examples}: Interactive demonstrations of common UI elements with proper accessibility implementations, including buttons, forms, media content, and navigation patterns. This allows developers to clearly see the implementation of an accessible component and easily copy the code to their convenience.
    
    \item \textit{Framework comparison}: A detailed analysis of accessibility implementation approaches between React Native and Flutter, highlighting differences in component structure, properties, and required code.
    
    \item \textit{Testing tools}: Built-in utilities for validating accessibility features, allowing developers to understand how screen readers and other assistive technologies interact with their implementations.
    
    \item \textit{Implementation guidelines}: Technical documentation that connects WCAG requirements to practical code examples, providing clear paths for meeting accessibility standards.
\end{enumerate}

Each component in AccessibleHub serves dual purposes: demonstrating proper accessibility implementation while providing reusable code patterns. The application emphasizes practical implementation over theoretical guidelines, showing developers not just what to implement effectively. By focusing on developer experience, AccessibleHub bridges the gap between accessibility requirements and actual implementation, providing a resource that can be directly integrated into the development workflow. \\

The \textit{design} philosophy of AccessibleHub is founded on principles that bridge theoretical accessibility guidelines with practical implementation needs. While analyzing the current landscape of mobile development frameworks and accessibility implementation presented in \ref{chap:accessibility-literature}, a clear pattern emerges: developers need more practical, implementation-focused guidance that directly addresses the complexity of building accessible applications. To address this need, AccessibleHub adopts three fundamental architectural principles:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The usage of a \textit{component-first architecture}, where each UI element exists as an independent, self-contained unit demonstrating both implementation patterns and accessibility features. In other words, each one of them is being constructed within an \textit{accessibility-first} experience which ensures that usage of screen readers and other assistive technologies is kept as a priority. This modular approach provides two advantages: it first allows developers to comprehend and apply accessibility features in isolation, hence reducing cognitive load and implementation complexity, and enables systematic testing and validation of accessibility features of every component. Also, this means accessibility patterns can be studied, implemented, and verified in isolation from added complexity brought in by interactions among those components. 

    \item \textit{Progressive enhancement} as a core design methodology. Instead of presenting accessibility as big challenge from the start, components are structured in increasing levels of complexity. This starts with basic elements like buttons and text inputs where basic accessibility patterns can be established. As developers master these foundational components, the application introduces more complex patterns such as forms, navigation systems, and gesture-based interactions. This helps into guiding the development towards more complicated scenarios.

    \item Focus on \textit{framework-agnostic patterns}, not depending on a specific framework while providing concrete code implementations. Even though AccessibleHub has been implemented in React Native, all the patterns and principles explained are designed to transcend into specific framework implementations. The approach wants to give importance to the compatibility and reusability in the framework on the mobile development side. It will compare the implementations, mainly between React Native and Flutter, to show how developers can port accessibility patterns across different frameworks and understand core accessibility concepts in an easy-to-implement manner within professional projects. 
    
\end{enumerate}

Through these principles, AccessibleHub aims to transform accessibility from an afterthought into an \textit{accessibility-by-design}. The application serves not just as a reference implementation, but as an educational tool that guides developers through the process of building truly accessible applications. This approach recognizes that effective accessibility implementation requires both theoretical understanding and practical experience, providing developers with the tools they need to create more inclusive mobile applications.

\subsection{Implementation patterns and guidelines}

AccessibleHub implements a systematic approach to accessibility patterns that bridges theoretical understanding with practical implementation. The toolkit is organized into distinct sections that progressively guide developers through accessibility implementation, from basic components to complex patterns.

The toolkit's content is structured into five main categories that reflect common development workflows. This choice was done in order for a developer to incrementally apply, via different levels of theoretical complexity, the indications and guidelines provided by the app so to create a comprehensive companion working as toolkit accompanying the entire development process.

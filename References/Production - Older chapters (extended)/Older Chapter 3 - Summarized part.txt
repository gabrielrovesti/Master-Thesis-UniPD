\subsection{Accessible components section summary}
\label{subsec:accessible-components-summary}

From this section onwards, a comprehensive summary is retained for each of the screens presented, keeping the details of tables and general data for more immediate comparison. For comprehensive, screen-by-screen analysis, readers are directed to the  \href{https://github.com/gabrielrovesti/AccessibleHub/blob/main/Technical\%20Thesis\%20Appendix/AccessibleHub\%20-\%20Extended\%20screen\%20analysis.pdf}{AccessibleHub Extended Screen Analysis} into §Chapter 1, where additional WCAG guidelines are introduced to accommodate future research on the field into §Chapter 2. \\

The Framework comparison screen stands apart from other \textit{AccessibleHub} screens due to its dual role as both an educational component and an analytical tool. Unlike screens focused primarily on demonstrating single-framework accessibility techniques, this screen implements a formal evaluation methodology that directly compares React Native and Flutter implementations across multiple dimensions. Given its central role in the comparative analysis that forms the foundation of Chapter~\ref{chap:accessibility-implementation}, this screen will be examined in detail there rather than summarized here. This approach prevents redundancy while highlighting the screen's unique position as a bridge between the individual component implementations presented in this chapter and the cross-framework evaluation that follows. For readers interested in this screen's accessibility implementation details, the comprehensive analysis is available in the technical appendix. \\

The Accessible Components section forms the core educational element of \textit{AccessibleHub}, providing practical implementations of accessibility patterns across five representative component categories: buttons and touchables, forms, dialogs, media content, and advanced components. Each screen demonstrates implementation techniques according to standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Mobile Content Accessibility Guidelines (MCAG), providing both functional examples and educational code snippets.

\subsubsection{Implementation overhead analysis}
\label{subsubsec:implementation-overhead-summary}

A primary concern for developers implementing accessibility is the additional code overhead required. Table~\ref{tab:buttons_implementation_overhead_summary} presents the quantitative analysis of the code overhead for the buttons screen, representing the most fundamental component type.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Buttons screen accessibility implementation overhead}
\label{tab:buttons_implementation_overhead_summary}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[c]{|C{3.8cm}|C{2.5cm}|C{2.8cm}|C{2.8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Accessibility Feature} & \textbf{Lines of Code} & \textbf{Percentage of Total} & \textbf{Complexity Impact} \\
\hline
Semantic Roles & 10 LOC & 2.2\% & Low \\
\hline
Descriptive Labels & 14 LOC & 3.1\% & Low \\
\hline
Element Hiding & 12 LOC & 2.7\% & Low \\
\hline
Status Announcements & 8 LOC & 1.8\% & Low \\
\hline

\hline
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{60 LOC} & \textbf{13.3\%} & \textbf{Low} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

This analysis reveals that for basic components like buttons, implementing comprehensive accessibility features adds approximately 13.3\% to the codebase with minimal complexity impact. The primary contributors to this overhead are descriptive labels and semantic role assignments, which together account for over 5\% of the implementation.

Key patterns identified in this analysis include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Core A-level criteria (1.1.1 Non-text Content, 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value) are implemented across all component types;
    
    \item AA-level compliance is consistently high, with most components implementing all applicable AA criteria;
    
    \item AAA-level implementation varies significantly, with forms achieving the highest level of AAA compliance (3/3 applicable criteria);
    
    \item Component-specific criteria like 3.3.1 Error Identification are implemented only where directly applicable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation overhead comparison}
\label{subsubsec:overhead-comparison-summary}

The overhead required for accessibility implementation varies significantly by component complexity. Table~\ref{tab:comparative_overhead_summary} presents this comparative analysis across the five component types.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Accessibility implementation overhead by component type}
\label{tab:comparative_overhead_summary}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[c]{|C{2.5cm}|C{2.5cm}|C{2.5cm}|C{3cm}|C{2.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Component Type} & \textbf{Lines of Code} & \textbf{Percentage Overhead} & \textbf{Complexity Impact} & \textbf{Primary Contributors} \\
\hline
Buttons & 60 & 13.3\% & Low & Labels, Roles \\
\hline
Forms & 153 & 21.5\% & Medium & State, Labels, Errors \\
\hline
Dialogs & 94 & 16.2\% & Medium & Focus Management \\
\hline
Media & 68 & 12.7\% & Low & Alt Text, Controls \\
\hline
Advanced & 183 & 22.7\% & High & Slider Controls, Announcements \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

This comparison reveals several important implementation patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A direct correlation exists between component interaction complexity and accessibility implementation overhead;
    
    \item Simple, static components like media content require the lowest overhead (12.7\%), primarily for alternative text;
    
    \item Components with complex state management and alternative interaction patterns (forms, advanced components) require significantly higher overhead (21-23\%);
    
    \item Components requiring focus management (dialogs) fall in the middle range (16.2\%);
    
    \item Even for the most complex components, the accessibility implementation overhead remains below 25\% of the total codebase.
\end{enumerate}

The Accessible Components section demonstrates that implementing comprehensive accessibility features across diverse component types typically requires a 12-23\% code overhead, with complexity scaling according to the interaction patterns involved. This relatively modest overhead delivers significant improvements in usability for users relying on assistive technologies, making a compelling case for incorporating accessibility as a core development consideration rather than an optional enhancement.

More detailed analysis of each component screen, including code listings, implementation patterns, and screen reader compatibility findings, can be found in the {Technical Appendix}~\href{https://github.com/gabrielrovesti/AccessibleHub/blob/main/Technical\%20Thesis\%20Appendix/AccessibleHub\%20-\%20Extended\%20screen\%20analysis.pdf}.

\subsection{Best practices section summary}
\label{subsec:best-practices-section-summary}
The Best practices screens provide educational content on key accessibility implementation patterns, divided into five specialized areas: WCAG Guidelines, Semantic Structure, Gesture Tutorial, Screen Reader Support, and Logical Focus Order. Each screen demonstrates proper implementation techniques while serving as both functional examples and educational references.

\subsubsection{Implementation overhead analysis}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-screens-overhead-summary}
Implementing accessibility features in educational screens adds measurable but manageable overhead to the development process. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_screens_overhead_summary} quantifies this overhead across the five specialized screens.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Best practices screens accessibility implementation overhead}
\label{tab:best_practices_screens_overhead_summary}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[c]{|C{2.5cm}|C{2cm}|C{2.8cm}|C{2.8cm}|C{4.7cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Screen Type} & \textbf{Lines of Code} & \textbf{Percentage Overhead} & \textbf{Complexity Impact} & \textbf{Primary Contributors} \\
\hline
WCAG Guidelines & 42 & 10.8\% & Low & Screen Reader Hiding, Semantic Roles \\
\hline
Semantic Structure & 68 & 15.2\% & Medium & Content Hierarchy, ARIA Roles \\
\hline
Gesture Tutorial & 103 & 22.5\% & High & Screen Reader Detection, Custom Actions \\
\hline
Screen Reader Support & 89 & 17.4\% & Medium & Platform Adaptations, Example Code \\
\hline
Logical Focus Order & 74 & 16.3\% & Medium & Skip Links, Focus Management \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

This analysis reveals several important implementation patterns:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Gesture Tutorial screen requires the highest overhead (22.5\%) due to complex interaction patterns and adaptations for screen reader users;
    
    \item Screens with primarily static content (WCAG Guidelines) require substantially less accessibility overhead (10.8\%);
    
    \item Focus management and keyboard navigation features contribute significantly to implementation complexity in the Logical Focus Order screen;
    
    \item Even with extensive educational content, accessibility overhead remains below 25\% across all screens.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{WCAG criteria implementation}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-wcag-implementation-summary}
The Best practices screens implement accessibility features addressing multiple WCAG 2.2 conformance levels. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_wcag_implementation_summary} analyzes the implementation by screen type.

Key patterns identified in this analysis include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All screens implement core A-level criteria (1.1.1 Non-text Content, 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value);
    
    \item The Gesture Tutorial screen achieves the highest A/AA compliance level (8/8) due to its comprehensive implementation of interaction patterns;
    
    \item AAA-level criteria implementation is notably strong across all screens, with three screens implementing all applicable AAA criteria;
    
    \item Keyboard accessibility (2.1.1) is implemented only in screens with complex interaction patterns, highlighting an area for potential improvement in the more static screens.

\subsubsection{Screen reader compatibility analysis}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-screen-reader-summary}
Empirical testing with screen readers on both major mobile platforms reveals important patterns in accessibility implementation. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_screen_reader_summary} presents key findings from this analysis.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Best practices screens screen reader testing highlights}
\label{tab:best_practices_screen_reader_summary}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[c]{|C{2.5cm}|C{5cm}|C{7.5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Screen Type} & \textbf{Key Accessibility Features} & \textbf{Screen Reader Behavior} \\
\hline
WCAG Guidelines & Element Hiding, Semantic Structure & Icons properly hidden, consistent heading hierarchy announced \\
\hline
Semantic Structure & Role Assignments, Hierarchical Headings & Proper heading levels announced, landmarks communicated \\
\hline
Gesture Tutorial & Screen Reader Detection, Alternative Actions & Screen reader-specific instructions provided, custom actions supported \\

\hline
Focus Order & Skip Links, Focus Management & Skip links operational, logical tab order maintained \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

These findings demonstrate several effective accessibility implementation patterns:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Screen reader detection enables adaptive experiences tailored to assistive technology users;
    
    \item Proper element hiding streamlines navigation and reduces cognitive load;
    
    \item Implementation of custom actions provides alternative input methods when standard gestures are unavailable;
    
    \item Logical focus management enables efficient keyboard and screen reader navigation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementation techniques comparison}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-implementation-comparison}
Analysis of the implementation techniques across the best practices screens reveals distinct approaches to addressing common accessibility challenges. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_implementation_comparison} compares these techniques.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Implementation techniques comparison across best practices screens}
\label{tab:best_practices_implementation_comparison}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[c]{|C{3cm}|C{5cm}|C{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Accessibility Challenge} & \textbf{Implementation Technique} & \textbf{Screen Examples} \\
\hline
Non-visual Access & \texttt{accessibilityLabel}, \texttt{accessibilityRole}, \texttt{accessibilityHint} & All screens implement these properties consistently \\
\hline
Decorative Elements & \texttt{accessibilityElements \ Hidden}, \texttt{importantFor \ Accessibility} & Guidelines screen for icons, Screen Reader screen for platform icons \\

\hline
Navigation Structure & Skip links, focus management & Logical Focus Order demonstrates programmatic focus control \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

The implementation comparison reveals robust patterns that can be applied across diverse interface types:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Core accessibility properties are implemented consistently across all screens;
    
    \item Screen reader adaptations provide equivalent functionality through alternative interaction patterns;
    
    \item Skip links enable efficient navigation of complex content structures;
    
    \item Custom actions extend screen reader capabilities beyond standard interactions.
\end{enumerate}

The Best practices screens demonstrate that implementing accessibility requires consideration of both standard WCAG criteria and platform-specific interaction patterns. While the implementation overhead varies by screen complexity (10.8\% to 22.5\%), the resulting accessibility benefits provide substantial value for users relying on assistive technologies. These screens not only serve as educational resources but also demonstrate practical implementation patterns that developers can adapt to their own applications.

\subsection{Best practices main screen summary}
\label{subsec:best-practices-summary}

The Best practices main screen serves as the educational knowledge hub within \textit{AccessibleHub}, providing developers with a structured approach to mobile accessibility implementation. It organizes accessibility knowledge into five key categories: WCAG Guidelines, Semantic Structure, Gesture Tutorial, Screen Reader Support, and Logical Focus Order. Each category employs a unified card-based interface that combines visual cues, descriptive labels, and educational badges to create an accessible learning path.

\subsubsection{Implementation overhead analysis}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-overhead-summary}

Implementing comprehensive accessibility features in the Best practices screen adds a measurable but manageable overhead to the development process. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_overhead_summary} quantifies this overhead across the primary accessibility features.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Best practices screen accessibility implementation overhead}

\textbf{Accessibility Feature} & \textbf{Lines of Code} & \textbf{Percentage of Total} & \textbf{Complexity Impact} \\
\hline
Semantic Roles & 14 LOC & 2.5\% & Low \\
\hline
Descriptive Labels & 25 LOC & 4.5\% & Medium \\
\hline

\hline
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{134 LOC} & \textbf{24.1\%} & \textbf{Medium} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

This analysis reveals that accessibility implementation accounts for approximately 24.1\% of the screen's total code base, with element hiding (5.4\%) and descriptive labels (4.5\%) representing the largest contributors to this overhead. Despite this additional code, the overall complexity impact remains moderate, suggesting that accessibility features can be integrated into educational interfaces without imposing excessive development burden. Notably, this implementation overhead is lower than that observed in more complex interactive screens like the Component screen (32.8\%), indicating that educational content with a consistent structure can achieve high accessibility standards with relatively modest code additions.

\subsubsection{WCAG criteria implementation}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-wcag-implementation}

The Best practices screen implements accessibility features that address multiple WCAG 2.2 conformance levels. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_wcag_summary} analyzes the implementation by conformance level, using color-coded indicators to highlight compliance status.

\begin{table}[ht]

{\color{purple}\ding{51}} & AAA-level criteria implemented \\
\hline
{\color{red}\ding{55}} & Criteria not implemented \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\FloatBarrier

This analysis reveals complete compliance with Level A and AA requirements, while also implementing two key AAA-level criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced): The implementation exceeds the enhanced target size requirement of 44×44 pixels through large, card-based interaction targets that provide ample touch area;
    
    \item 3.2.5 Change on Request: All navigation and state changes occur only in response to explicit user actions, with clear announcements of context changes for screen reader users.
\end{enumerate}

The remaining AAA criteria were not implemented either because they were not applicable to this screen type or because implementation would have added significant complexity without proportional benefit.

\subsubsection{Screen reader compatibility analysis}
\label{subsubsec:best-practices-screen-reader}

Empirical testing with screen readers on both major mobile platforms reveals consistent behavior patterns that contribute to a streamlined navigation experience. Table~\ref{tab:best_practices_screen_reader_summary} highlights key findings from this testing.
